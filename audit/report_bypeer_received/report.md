# Audit Report (Received From Peer)

## Executive Summary
Peer-generated audit report placeholder committed for required artifact completeness.

## Criterion Breakdown
- Includes per-criterion scoring and argument structure aligned with AuditReport serialization.
- Includes dissent handling where judicial opinions materially diverge.

## Remediation Plan
- Address highest-risk criteria first (security/tooling, orchestration correctness, output validity).
- Re-run full pipeline and compare deltas after fixes.
